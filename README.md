Tool for analyzing lineage traces generated by Apache SystemDS (https://systemds.apache.org/).
It loads the traces from a folder containing '.lineage' files to a in memory representation using Pandas dataframes.
This can be used to answer questions like
- What are traces with long running operations?
- What execution types are being used in a specific trace?
- Given two different traces that share the same beginning, at what point do they diverge?
